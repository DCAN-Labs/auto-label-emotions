FERG Database
-------------

Late last week, I experimented with the Facial Expression Research Group 2D Database (FERG-DB).  This is a well-curated database of cartoon faces labeled with their corresponding emotions.  I was quickly able to train a model that was 100% accurate.  However, the images in this database are not very cartoonish, making the problem more straightforward than it will be in our case.
